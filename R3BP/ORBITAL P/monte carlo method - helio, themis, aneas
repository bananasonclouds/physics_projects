-Table orbital elements vs JPL results w percentage difference w plot showing the standard error w each orbital parameter one over the other 
either same objects vs orbital paramteers or same parameters vs objects
-Table of orbital element, jpl value, jack knife value, spread
-Plot of year vs standard error/ arcsec
-Residual graph, 6 obs to 14obs show factor of improvement by increasing no of obs to show weâ€™ve done enough
-Residual of range, eg 50 days residual over 2 weeks
-Plot of Differneces in position for one object for JPL vs our result
